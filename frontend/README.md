# Njangi Group Project: Web App for Tracking and Managing Contributions

## About the Project

The Njangi Group Project is a web application designed to digitize and streamline the traditional "Njangi" system, also known as Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs). This platform allows members to:

- Track their contributions.
- View payout schedules.
- Facilitate secure digital contributions.

The goal of this project is to modernize the Njangi system, making it more accessible, transparent, and efficient for users.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main folders:

1. **Frontend**:  
   This folder contains the client-side code, which is responsible for the user interface and user experience. It is built using modern web technologies such as **React** and **TypeScript**.

2. **Backend**:  
   This folder contains the server-side code, which handles the business logic, data storage, and API endpoints. It ensures secure and efficient management of user data and contributions.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for members.
- **Contribution Tracking**: Keep a record of all contributions made by members.
- **Payout Scheduling**: View and manage payout schedules for the group.
- **Notifications**: Reminders for upcoming contributions or payouts.
- **Digital Payments**: (Optional) Facilitate secure online contributions.

## Technologies Used
